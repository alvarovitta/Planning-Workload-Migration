# Profiling your Workloads - draft

Perform detailed analysis on the potential cloud candidates identified in the portfolio.

<br />
<br />

## Guidance

The purpose of a detailed assessment is to gain a deep enough understanding of each application to determine whether, and if so how, its functionality should be provided in the cloud. This process involves examining existing applications from a number of different perspectives, including:

* Workload characteristics, such as elasticity, scalability, resource intensiveness, latency, and throughput
* Architecture characteristics, such as UI complexity, device compatibility, application complexity, application life 
  expectancy, requirements for use of structured and unstructured data,  and life expectancy of existing hardware
* Financial characteristics, including the operating cost of the existing application (for many organizations this will be
  an estimate, based on peer data or sampling)
* Risk characteristics, including organizational risk, business criticality, technical risk, resource risks and      
  contractual risks
* Operations characteristics, such as requirements for business continuity, tools to support the application, and ease of 
  deployment
* Security and compliance considerations, such as requirements associated with data jurisdiction, regulatory compliance, 
  privacy, and encryption
<br />
<br />

## Preparation

For each workload being assessed gather the following information:Â 
<br />

  1. Capability - e.g., CRM, ERP, HR, etc.

  2. Name of workload

  3. Business Owner name

  4. Technical Owner name
<br />
<br />

## Procedure - How to assess your applications and assign values to your profile

Use this procedure to assess the characteristics and considerations for migrating your applications.
<br />

  1. Workload characteristics - for each workload, assign a value for each attribute described below.

<br />
<br />

  3. Architecture (Application) - for each workload, assign a value for each attribue described below.

| Application Life Expectancy | The shorter the life expectancy, the<br /> greater the advantages of moving<br /> to the cloud. We are considering<br /> app life expectancy in terms of<br /> the technologies that are used<br /> to build the app; if those<br /> technologies are nearing end <br /> of support (e.g., Windows 2008), <br /> then they are ripe for moving to the cloud. | 1 = Greater than 3 years <br /> 2 = 2-3 years <br /> 3 = 1-2 years <br /> 4 = 6 months to 1 year <br /> 5 = Less than 6 months | xxx |
