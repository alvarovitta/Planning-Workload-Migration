# Profiling your Workloads - draft

Perform detailed analysis on the potential cloud candidates identified in the portfolio.

## Guidance

The purpose of a detailed assessment is to gain a deep enough understanding of each application to determine whether, and if so how, its functionality should be provided in the cloud. This process involves examining existing applications from a number of different perspectives, including:

* Workload characteristics, such as elasticity, scalability, resource intensiveness, latency, and throughput)
  Architecture characteristics, such as UI complexity, device compatibility, application complexity, application life 
  expectancy, requirements for use of structured and unstructured data,  and life expectancy of existing hardware
* Financial characteristics, including the operating cost of the existing application (for many organizations this will be
  an estimate, based on peer data or sampling).
* Risk characteristics, including organizational risk, business criticality, technical risk, resource risks and      
  contractual risks.
* Operations characteristics, such as requirements for business continuity, tools to support the application, and ease of 
  deployment.
* Security and compliance considerations, such as requirements associated with data jurisdiction, regulatory compliance, 
  privacy, and encryption.

## Preparation

For each workload being assessed gather the following information:Â 

  1. Capability - e.g. CRM, ERP, HR, etc.
	
  2. Name of workload

  3. Business Owner name

  4. Technical Owner name

  5. Workload characteristics
     
     Elasticity
     1. Low (Consistent load)
     2. Med Low (Moderate spikes regularly)
     3. Med (Moderate spikes occasionally)
     4. Med High (Severe spikes regularly)
     5. High (Severe spikes occasionally) 

     Scalability
     1. Consistent Load
     2. Slow, Linear Growth
     3. Fast, Linear Growth
     4. Known Exponential Growth
     5. Forecasted Exponential Growth with Unknown Dates and Growth

     Resource Intensiveness
     1. Informational
     3. Single dimension analysis
     5. Multi-dimensional analysis such as required by certain scientific capabilities

     Latency
     1. '>' 500ms
     2. < 500ms
     3. < 200ms (Consumer web application)
     4. < 100ms
     5. High Performance Computing (<1ms)

     Throughput
     1. < 1 Mbps
     2. 1-5 Mbps
     3. 5-25 Mbps
     4. 25-50 Mbps
     5. > 100 MBps (Multi-media and gaming)
