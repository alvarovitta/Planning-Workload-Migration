# Categorizing your Portfolio
Use the information in this section to gather a list of the organization's application inventory and categorize each applicaiton.
<br />
<br />

Many organizations have thousands of applications and workloads to be categorized. Consider prioritizing smaller, more manageable sets of workloads moving to the cloud first. This is done through categorization of the portfolio.
<br />
<br />

## Guidance
To categorize the portfolio, an organization can group workloads according to selected criteria such as: 

* Unclassified vs classified workloads 

* Line of Business 
* Similar business capabilities, e.g., all Case Management applications 
* Applications reaching End-of-Life (EOL)
* Pace of change

Subdividing according to pace of change, lifetime, and planning horizon will further assist your organization in determining the appropriate "R" (Rehost, Refactor/Revise, Rebuild, Retire) migration strategy required. For example, an application that undergoes rapid, very frequent, and ad hoc changes on a weekly basis would be a great fit for the cloud. Categorizing the portfolio will help to identify areas for consolidation and rationalization.

Use the following table to help categorize applications according to their Pace of Change.

|**Pace of change** |**Slow, Infrequent, incremental.<br /><br />Changes every 6 to 12 months.** |**Moderate, more frequent, configurability is key.<br /><br />Changes every 3 to 6 months.** |**Rapid, very frequent, ad hoc. "Throwaway" customization.<br /><br />Changes weekly, sometimes daily.** |
|:-------------| :-------------| :-------------| :------------|
|**Lifetime** |10+ years |2 to 5 years|3 to 12 months|
**Planning Horizon**|7+ years |1 to 2 years |Up to 6 months|
<br />
<br />
	
In categorizing the portfolio, identify the applications that will reach EOL in the next 1-3 years, and place them in a separate group. These applications and their associated workloads would not be assessed initially because they are not a good fit for the cloud since there will be little to no investment in the applications.
<br />
<br />

## Preparation
Many enterprises already have an application portfolio management system in which a list of applications and workloads is maintained. This can be leveraged for cloud assessment purposes. Others might need to use an ad hoc tool such as a spreadsheet. Either can be effective.

Obtain access to the organization's Application Portfolio Management system or system where an inventory of workload and application information is kept.

Create an initial set of categories using the Guidance above. At a minimum, there should be a category for Applications nearing EOL.

## Procedure - How to Categorize your Portfolio
1. Assemble a team of stakeholders to review the organization's application portfolio; this team can be composed of application owners,  IT support team, Cloud Program Team and business analysts.

2. Review the initial set of categories with stakeholders and determine the final set.

3. Assign a category to each workload and document. A workload can be part of more than one category, e.g., rapid pace of change and customer relationship management
