# Defining a Cloud Strategy

Use the information in this section to begin capturing your organization's needs and plan your workload migration strategy accordingly.

Completing a Cloud Strategy Document is the first step in planning your workload migration to Azure.


Refer to, and use the following in sequence to plan your cloud strategy:

1. Review the Cloud Strategy Document template

2. Create a Cloud Program Team 

## Guidance

The Cloud Strategy Document template provides:
* a summary of drivers, challenges, business, and end-user requirements
* a definition: why Cloud and how leveraging the Cloud benefits the business now
* opportunity to document business objectives and the targets to be achieved from Cloud use
* instructions to help measure Cloud adoption success 
* indicators for challenges and risks
* a Cloud framework with attributes and service models for the organization 
* opportunity to identify the Cloud Program Team or Cloud Competency Center structure
* the Cloud Strategy for consumption, building, securing, and managing hybrid applications

High-level recommendations for completing a Cloud Strategy Document are:
* Commit to a Cloud-Readiness journey – This requires allocating resources, time and management commitment.  Sustained effort only
  occurs with an organizational commitment.
* Form a Cloud Program team – The efforts required cross organizational boundaries, and are multi-factored.  As a result 
  a team needs to be created with a focus on achieving the desired results.
* Include the business as stakeholders in the process – Organizations that are successful in cloud adoption have strong 
  business commitment and involvement in the process.
* Engage Application support and release management – Changes to the application development, support, and release 	
  management processes will form a core part of the readiness required to adopt the cloud.
* Engage current Service providers to participate – leverage existing relationships and partnerships with existing 
  technology suppliers that need to engage in the process and may form a vital part of the cloud hosting eco-system.
* Treat the adoption and readiness as a program with projects covering:

	- Contracts
	- Service Management
	- Security and compliance
	- Operations Readiness
	- Application development 
	- Infrastructure
